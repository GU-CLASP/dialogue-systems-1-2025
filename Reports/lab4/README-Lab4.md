## Testing the flow

After being asked to "give" your intent you have the ability to either state that you "want to know who X" is (here I give the options Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan or Martin Seligman). The term "Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi" is difficult for the system to recognise.

Alternatively you can ask to create a meeting. Two entities can be "pre-provided" in the intent. The meeting day, i.e. "Create a meeting for Friday", the person "Create a meeting with Dylan" or both "Create a meeting for Monday with Mom". The flow of the dialogue manager will then automatically proceed to ask the other questions.

Hope this helps.
