        In this game, you'll have the chance to interrogate 6 people that are now in the same place about their role in this context.  
        <b>Your goal is to guess which person does not belong in the context.</b>
        You can ask each person multiple questions, that will be answered with a variation of yes/no answers.
        Whenever you want to switch to ask the next person, just say: "next". 
        Try to keep your questions the least personal as possible. For example, don't ask questions such as <i>'Do you like what you're doing?'; </i> 
        But you can ask if what they're doing is stressful or if where they are is a happy place or not. If you want some inspiration for what to ask, press the <i>help</i> button.
