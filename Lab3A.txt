I tried two Harry Potter related entries and one entry which is a Turkish city.
The first thing I have tried was Patronus charm in Harry Potter movies and books which is called by chanting Expecto Patronum.
Honestly, I did not expect it would understand it so well, considering the fact that it is not real besides a fantasy lore community, 
but considering the fact that Harry Potter is a well-established franchise now, it is understandable how it could predict them so well.

"Expecto Patronum"
{utterance: Expect Patronum, confidence: 0.2960726}
{utterance: Expect Patronum, confidence: 0.21106607}
{utterance: Expect Patronum, confidence: 0.43031952}

Honestly, the confidence scores were no that high but it predicted the result correctly each time. 
This might be due to the fact that the word 'Expecto Patronum' sounds really distinctive.

Secondly, I have Draco Malfoy, an antagonist from the Harry Potter series.

"Draco Malfoy"
{utterance: Draco Malfoy, confidence: 0.53959596}
{utterance: Draco Malfoy, confidence: 0.56635284}
{utterance: Draco Malfoy, confidence: 0.45600995}

On interesting thing was, however, when I said "Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy" the confidence score turned out be 0.7691264.
This is interesting because providing more context to the Draco Malfoy (which is an uncommon name) by uttering it with "Harry Potter" made the confidence higher.

Lastly, I tried a city from Turkey: Erzurum. The results were a disaster:

"Erzurum"
{utterance: Arizona Room, confidence: 0.064343825}
{utterance: Add this room, confidence: 0.56635284}
{utterance: Add the room, confidence: 0.1613791}

Then I tried it with other better-known cities the it recognized "Erzurum" each time with nice confidence.

"Istanbul, Ankara, Erzurum"
{utterance: Istanbul, Ankara, Erzurum, confidence: 0.53043926}
{utterance: Istanbul, Ankara, Erzurum, confidence: 0.61920446}

This was very impressive to witness, how much context helps the machine to correct itself even though my pronunciation was clear each time. 
Of course, a lesser known Turkish city like Erzurum is less likely to be its first guess.
But next to cities like Istanbul and Ankara, it is really likely.
