## How to deploy your app
1.  Use SSH to login to eduserv.
2.  Create a folder in `/srv/www/` with the same name as your gus-account, e.g. `gusxxxxxx`.
3.  Build your app: `yarn build --base=gusxxxxxx`, this will produce a `dist` directory with a few files in it. (More information can be found in [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)). 
    - If you are getting errors, you might consider excluding some of your files in `tsconfig.json` (i.e. `"exclude": ["src/dmParallel.ts", "src/dm2.ts"]`)
4.  Copy the contents of this directory to your folder on the server:
    
        scp -r dist/* eduserv:/srv/www/gusxxxxxx/
5.  Access your app at <https://eduserv.flov.gu.se:9000/gusxxxxxx> (protected by password).

Note: in some cases, the access rights are incorrectly set. In this case you are likely to see the HTML page but other code wonâ€™t load. In this case run the following command in your `/srv/www/gusxxxxxx/` directory:
    
    chmod -R a+rX assets
