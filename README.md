# dialogue-systems-1-2025 Lab Work

### How does the system works: 
1. Click the button, and the system will start listening to the user;
2. If no user speech input is detected, it will go to idle again, and the user can click again;
3. If it recognises the user's speech input, the system will say, "Let's create an appointment!"
4. After an appointment is booked, users can click the button again to book another one.
