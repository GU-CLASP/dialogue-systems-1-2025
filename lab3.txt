My hypothesis is that the machine will have issues with phonemes which 
are not in english/the assigned language. Hence, I tested some swedish 
words wich consisted of phonemes which wouldn't be found (in standard)
English:

Word tested: Göteborg
certainty: 0.08830869, 0.6616148, 0.1313996
though I said: Ye de Bourre, Yet the bore, He has to bore you

Word tested: kex (translation: biscuite)
certainty: 0.6798867, 0.20087129, 0.39452058
though I said: kicks, kicks, kicks

Word tested: Långben (translation: Goofy (from Mickey Mouse))
certainty: 0.064350836, 0.10604273, 0.11188358
though I said: Longbian, long beyond, Longbian

Word tested: Andra Långgatan
certainty: 0.13732457
though I said: Andra Longgarten

Word tested: Järntorget
certainty: 0.105675586
thought I said: you haven't told yet

Based on the words I tested my hypothesis seems to check out. The system
tries to find a word/phrase in its vocabulary which is phonetically 
close to the utterance, but can't since the word is not in its vocabulary.
Hence, the certainty remains low. Consequently, the ASR cannot handle 
codeswitching even if the word is a placename. The entire utterance
needs to be in one language -- resulting in an inability to hande any 
utterance which is not found in the vocabulary of the language picked in 
the settings.

For part B I picked the poem 'Jag såg ett träd' by Edith Södergran
