After my submission of the Lab2 and a few more trials on my previous code, I have realised that I have implied falsely about changing the TTS voice to sv-SE affecting the ASR. They were just lucky confidence scores and I was biased to utter words such as Christine and Staffan in a Swedish phonetic inventory. ("Staffan" and "Aya" was the most challenging word to transcribe correctly.) I kept searching for an answer to this problem (that the automatic speech recognizer does not always transcribe what we were expecting) and before starting the Lab3, I have found the most effective solution to be customizing the language model of our ASR via biasing our grammar words and therefore strenghtening their confidence scores to be helpful for our purpose driven dialogue systems, such as creating an appointment system with certain and limited options. Now I am starting the Lab3 and let's see how my opinions will change.

1 & 2: (see dm.ts)
Considering my native and/or comfortable phonetic inventory related to this project, my test-set is:
Valar, Maiar, Mithrandir, Valinor, Manwë, Gondolin (Elvish/Quenya) (Tolkien: https://tolklang.quettar.org/pronguide.html)
Bursa, Kastamonu, Iğdır, Bodrum, Marmaris, Antalya, Batman, Samsun (Turkish)
Gävle, Söderhamn, Ullevi, Stockholm, Malmö, Ljusdal, Torsby
Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Limoges, Bourgeois, Châteauroux, Beaufay

Findings: (disregarding the diacritics)
-Popular words are transcribed with high confidence score and accent/phonetic inventory did not matter: (with surprisingly high correct transcription rate and confidence score on french accent) Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux,  Bodrum (low conf. score due to its resemblence to bedroom), Marmaris, Antalya (summer vacation places in Turkey), Mithrandir, Stockholm.
-Transcribed almost 100% correct with low confidence scores:  Valinor, Manwë, Gondolin, Bursa,  Batman,  Ullevi
-Valar is usually transcribed as Valor with low confidence (0.01) but at the 10th try it transcribed correctly with 0.1 confidence score. 
-Impossible to transcribe:  Gävle, Söderhamn, Malmö, Ljusdal, Torsby, Maiar, Kastamonu, Iğdır, Samsun, Beaufay.
-Very successful with french transcriptions: Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Limoges, Bourgeois, Châteauroux. Even if the confidence score is low, the transcription is consistently correct. Except one: Beaufay, which is transcribed as "buffet" every time. Sharing the category with Samsun which is transcribed either as Samsung or Samson very common words in English (even with Samsung not being an English word). Reason being they are very similar (even the same) in uttering to very popular words. Beufay has 0.5+ score every time and Samsun has around 0.01 since one phoneme is consistently lacking/different than Samson and Samsung (the way it is pronounced in English)
-My final conclusion is, popular and statistically more used words are biased and transcribed no matter what accent I am using and the others are phonetically matched to similar words that are more popular than them. But the ASR recognizing and transcribing almost every French name and almost none of the Swedish names is weird.  Confidence score in my experience is high if the expected phonemes that are existent in English are used when uttering. And when phonemes are different than expected the score lowers accordingly.

3: Training the ASR with introducing the words that we want to transcribe and feeding a lot of their pronunciations seems the effective solution. By augmenting our intended words' bias and exceeding the unintended words' bias should be the way. Otherwise the ASR should recognize the most popular words. That is, I believe it is all statistical. Recognition in my examples falter usually because they are not popular words and their pronunciations & transcriptions are not introduced to the language model of our ASR.
