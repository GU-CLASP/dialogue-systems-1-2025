For this case study, I tested it focusing on names recognition, particularly with common Brazilian names. I evaluated both in isolation and in contextual speech.
I found that the ASR system successfully recognized several common Brazilian names, such as "Fernanda," (0.544) "Maria" (0.766) and "Carlos" (0.796) with high accuracy. However, other names, especially those less frequent or with unique phonetic structures, had inconsistent recognition. Names with nasalized vowels or silent letters posed challenges. "Jusete" gives (0.04) and actually does not recognize it.
Even when names were spoken within a context, such as in a sentence, the recognition confidence was not good. For example, saying "Maria comprou um presente para Paula" (Maria bought a gift to Paula), (o.417) gives “Maria compron presente para Paola”. It did not understand that there was an indefinite article before the noun “presente” (gift) and even the name Paula was not understood.  
Overall, while it performed well with more familiar names, there is room for improvement in handling less common ones. Contextual information appears to play a significant role in improving accuracy, but not always.
